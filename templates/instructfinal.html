In summary, these are the basics of the task:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>All the TVs in the pretend town are tuned to <strong>CH1</strong> or <strong>CH2</strong>.
    <li>People tune their TVs to pick up the two channels by adjusting the
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Length</strong> of the bar and
        <li>Its <strong>Angle</strong>.
    </ul>
    <li>This means there will be two different "types" of antennas corresponding to the two channels.
    <li>There is small variation in settings due to differences in reception at different resident's houses.
    <li>Many TVs will be broken, but you can learn from both the broken and working TVs if you are clever
        and pay attention.
</ul>

<p>The game as two phases.  First, you will see many examples of TVs that are
    brought into the shop.  After viewing each, click
continue to move on to the next one. Try to figure out what might make a TV pick up
CH1 or CH2.  Afterwards, you will be shown a set of new TVs all with broken screens and 
will be asked to predict which channel they would pick up.</p>
